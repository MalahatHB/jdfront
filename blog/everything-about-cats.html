        It is estimated that there are around 720 million pet or stray cats
        worldwide. These playful felines are believed to have been domesticated
        for the first time around 7500 BC, and today they have become beloved
        members of families across the globe. Their mysterious personalities and
        adorable appearance have made cats incredibly popular as pets. However,
        there is still so much we don’t know about these cute and playful
        animals. In this article, we’ll explore everything about cats.

        <h2>The History of the Relationship Between Cats and Humans</h2>
        <p>
          Researchers have recently discovered that cats lived among people in
          Mesopotamia, Turkey, and the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean
          thousands of years before they appeared in Egypt. The ancient
          Egyptians began domesticating the African wildcat around 4,000 years
          ago. In ancient Egypt, people believed cats were magical, divine, and
          godlike. In fact, they worshipped a feline goddess named Bastet, who
          was depicted as half-cat, half-woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around 3,000 BCE, people in China also began domesticating cats.
          During the Song Dynasty (960–1279), cats were cherished as loyal pets.
          Artists depicted them in paintings and sculptures, and Chinese culture
          viewed cats as symbols of good luck. However, during the Middle Ages
          in Europe, cats were often associated with evil, darkness, and
          witchcraft. As a result, popes and high-ranking authorities condemned
          them, and cats were frequently tortured and killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cats arrived in North and South America alongside European settlers.
          As the settlers began farming, cats helped forge a unique human-animal
          bond by using their natural hunting skills to drive away rodents and
          by serving as loyal companions. Today, with nearly 74 million pet cats
          in homes, the domestic cat is the most popular pet worldwide.

      <div id="catsDomestication">
        <h2>Cat Domestication</h2>
        <p>
          This process shouldn't be considered traditional "domestication"! Cats
          have not undergone major changes during their domestication and have
          retained much of the appearance and behavior of their wild ancestors.
          These animals are still fully capable of surviving in the wild. There
          are two main theories regarding the domestication of cats. The first
          is that they were used to control pests, and the second relates to
          friendly interactions between humans and cats.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second theory is more likely, at least in the early stages of
          domestication, because if the goal had been strictly pest control,
          other animals such as mongooses or dogs would have been more effective
          and efficient. In both scenarios, several characteristics of cats—such
          as their small size, social nature, body language, love of play, high
          intelligence, and perhaps an innate tendency among felines to become
          tame—may have facilitated their domestication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strictly speaking, most cats aren't truly domesticated. However, one
          of the main appeals of owning cats in the modern world is that,
          despite being tame, they haven't changed much from their wild
          relatives and have retained their fundamental traits. Domestic cats
          also tolerate intense heat and show no signs of discomfort until their
          skin temperature exceeds 52°C (125.6°F).

        <h2>Introduction to Cat Breeds</h2>
        <p>
          The International Cat Association (TICA), the world’s largest genetic
          registry of pedigreed cats, recognizes 73 different breeds. However,
          the Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA), the largest cat registry in the
          United States, recognized 45 breeds in 2022. The Fédération
          Internationale Féline (FIFe), with member organizations in 40
          countries, recognizes 48 breeds divided into four categories.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several reasons why different organizations recognize
          different numbers of cat breeds. The simplest reason lies in their
          general classification methods. Some registries do not include
          non-pedigreed cats whose ancestry doesn’t go back a certain number of
          generations. In addition, some associations group several types of
          cats into one category, while others separate them into distinct
          breeds. As a result, there is no exact number for how many cat breeds
          exist.
        </p>
        <p>Here are 10 of the most popular and well-known breeds:</p>
        <ul class="cat-breeds">
          <li>Exotic Shorthair Cat</li>
          <li>Ragdoll Cat</li>
          <li>British Shorthair</li>
          <li>Persian Cat</li>
          <li>Maine Coon</li>
          <li>American Shorthair</li>
          <li>Scottish Fold</li>
          <li>Sphynx Cat</li>
          <li>Abyssinian Cat</li>
          <li>Devon Rex Cat</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="strayCats">
        <h2>A Closer Look at Stray Cats</h2>
        <p>
          Stray cats live short and difficult lives on the streets. These cats
          never die of old age. Contagious diseases such as calicivirus, feline
          immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukemia (FeLV), and feline
          infectious peritonitis (FIP) are common among cats left outdoors.
          Minor cuts or simple wounds can develop into severe infections and
          lead to various feline illnesses. Upper respiratory infections can
          cause a cat’s eyes and nose to become so affected that they struggle
          to see or breathe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others die due to blood loss or anemia caused by worms, fleas, ticks,
          or untreated injuries. Urinary tract infections—often leading to
          urinary blockages in male cats—can result in a slow and agonizing
          death if left untreated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if a cat miraculously escapes these dangers, it may still fall
          victim to painful deaths at the hands of cruel individuals. On the
          other hand, a feral cat may rarely learn to accept human companionship
          and live in a home. This is because a home is not a natural
          environment for a wild cat, and such a setting can be far more
          stressful than life outside in a colony. However, neutering and
          spaying services for stray cats can be an effective way to manage
          their population in urban areas.

        <h2>Are children safe around pets?</h2>
        <p>
          Here are some useful tips to ensure that your children and pets have a
          safe and happy relationship:
        </p>
        <ul class="children-and-pets">
          <li>
            Never leave a toddler unattended. Accidents can happen even with the
            most trustworthy pets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Never approach any animal while it is eating, sleeping, or even when
            it is caring for its babies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Always pet an animal gently, without pulling, and never from behind.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid loud noises or sudden movements when approaching an animal.
          </li>
          <li>
            If an adult says the pet is friendly, extend your hand with the palm
            facing up and gently move it toward the pet’s nose to let it sniff
            you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not touch the animal’s eyes, ears, nose, mouth, or genitals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid contact with dog or cat feces, which can transmit diseases.
            Young children are especially tempted to put their hands into the
            cat’s litter box, but this is dangerous.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not allow your child to touch or stand close to the pet when the
            child is overly excited.
          </li>
          <li>Do not allow your child to ride on large pets such as dogs.</li>
          <li>
            Make sure your children understand that a pet is a living creature
            that deserves respect. Animals have their own needs and feelings.
            Therefore, teach your children from an early age how to interact
            with pets. You can get necessary guidance from your veterinarian.

        <h2>How to care for your pet in cold weather?</h2>
        <p>
          Did you know that cold weather can pose a serious threat to your pet?
          Fur alone does not provide complete warmth, which is why caring for
          cats and other pets in cold weather is very important. Be aware of how
          your pet tolerates cold conditions. Thick blankets and towels are a
          great way to help keep your pet warm after coming inside from the
          cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Short-haired pets feel the cold faster because they have less
          protection. Pets with short legs and bodies closer to the ground feel
          the cold more quickly since their bodies have more contact with snow
          or ice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cold weather can worsen some medical conditions such as arthritis. For
          example, pets with diabetes or heart disease may have trouble
          regulating their body temperature during winter. Also, after every
          walk, dry your pet’s paws and belly to remove ice, salt, and
          chemicals. Dehydration in cold weather can be life-threatening. If
          your pets are outside, make sure their water bowls are filled with
          clean water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water in puddles or lakes can cause digestive problems for your pet
          and may even carry parasites or toxins. Chemicals used for melting
          snow or protecting gardens in winter are dangerous for pets. We all
          know that warm car engines can be a hazard to pets, so make sure your
          cat is not sleeping under the car.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="laserPointer">
        <h2>Laser Play with Cats: Yes or No?</h2>
        <p>
          Cats need enrichment and environmental stimulation to help them
          exercise and stay healthy. Playing with laser pointers can be a fun
          activity when used properly. However, shining the laser directly into
          your cat’s eyes can harm their vision. Laser light can burn a cat’s
          retina. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the higher
          the wattage of the laser light, the more dangerous it is—even brief
          exposure can cause damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          When playing laser games with your cat, follow these safety
          precautions:
        </p>
        <ul class="laser-games">
          <li>
            Use a low-wattage laser pointer with a maximum output of 5
            milliwatts.
          </li>
          <li>Never shine the light directly into your cat’s eyes.</li>
          <li>
            Store the laser toy in a safe place where your cat cannot access it.
          </li>
          <li>
            These guidelines apply to all light sources, including flashlights,
            which your cat may also enjoy chasing the bright spots from.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Playing with laser toys may also affect your furry friend’s mental
          well-being. Toys like laser pointers can cause frustration. Since cats
          are natural hunters, they become frustrated if they cannot experience
          the actual catch when pouncing on their prey. The reason cats are
          attracted to laser pointers is that the quick movements of the light
          mimic those of a living creature. Therefore, it is recommended that
          after each “hunt” with the laser pointer, you give your cat a small
          piece of food or treat to simulate a successful catch and prevent
          frustration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cats perceive the moving dot as a living thing worth catching. If your
          cat chases the laser light without paying attention to their
          surroundings and bumps into walls or furniture, laser pointers become
          a potential hazard. If you decide to use a laser pointer, make sure to
          do so in an open space where your cat is unlikely to get hurt.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="nightVision">
        <h2>Do cats have night vision?</h2>
        <p>
          Cats cannot see in complete darkness, but their vision is far more
          advanced than humans’ for all their nighttime adventures. The reason
          cats have excellent night vision lies in the clever design of their
          eyes. These animals have curved corneas and large lenses, and in low
          light, their pupils can dilate into almost perfect circles to maximize
          the amount of light entering their eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the photoreceptors in cats’ eyes are quite different from
          those in humans. Cats have more rod cells, which are responsible for
          peripheral vision and detecting movement at night, while humans have
          more cone cells that help them see colors and daylight better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cats also have a layer of cells called the tapetum lucidum, a
          reflective layer that bounces light back onto the retina. This tissue
          reflects light back to the sensory cells, allowing the retina to
          receive more than 50% of the available light. This layer is also the
          reason cats’ eyes shine in the dark.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may have often wondered why your cat’s pupils appear as vertical
          slits during the day, but become fully round at night or when they
          feel playful. This happens because vertical slit pupils allow less
          light to enter the eye during bright conditions, protecting the
          retinal cells from damage, and dilate widely in low light to let in
          more light. Interestingly, cats have a field of vision of about 200
          degrees, while humans have around 180 degrees. This means cats have a
          wider field of view.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Final Word</h2>
        <p>
          Having a cat can mean different things to different people. Some want
          a cat to cuddle or sit on their lap. Others enjoy playing with their
          cat. The important thing is to try to find a cat that connects well
          with you. Not all cats are the same, and how each cat behaves with you
          can depend on its inherent personality and early experiences. In any
          case, you should increase your knowledge about this animal so that you
          can both take good care of your cat and have a positive, constructive
          relationship with your furry friend.
